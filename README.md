# Plane Landing Madness
Title: 'Plane Landing Mandess'
Goal: Land as many possible planes to achieve the most amount of points with the given difficulty

How to play: 

Choose a difficulty. Easy has two runways with slow moving planes, and runways are less likely
to be closer to the edge of the map which makes it easier for the user. Medium contains faster moving planes,
that come in at a higher rate,as well as three runways. In hard mode, planes come even faster and very frequently.
In medium and hard mode, runways can be stacked on top of each other, which additionally complicates the level of play.

To land a plane successfully, you must select the plane, then select the 'change path' option, then select the plane
again and drag it to its desired location. Then you must select the plane again once it is done landing, and select
the 'taxi' option. This will send the plane to a parking spot and reward you with points. You can also speed up or slow 
down the planes to avoid collisions

Losing:
To lose, one must make two planes crash on either the ground or in  the air. No plane on the ground can collide with 
any plane in the air and vice versa. Additionally, one may lose if any given plane is not attended to and files off 
of the screen, or is directed off the screen.

File to run is tp3.py
